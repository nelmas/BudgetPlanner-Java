## Overview

This project simulates a budget planning application tailored for students. It allows management of multiple student profiles, each with their own budgets, incomes, and expenditures. The system calculates financial balances and generates simple reports.

The main goal of this project is to practice object-oriented programming concepts, system design, and debugging skills by identifying and fixing intentional bugs within the codebase.
